# Ring Buffer

This is a Ring Buffer Implementation in C.

This project targets to deliver a memory efficient implementation of
Ring BUffer in C. Performance aspects were privileged over safety, hence we don't make safety checks before manipulating the buffer.  Fore example, we don't verify if the buffer is already full before inserting a new element, nor we verify if the buffer is empty before getting a new element. Users should be advised to do so in upper layers.

# Using RingBuffer in C

You need to add the sources locate at **src/** in your project. This implementation is well suited for embedded systems.

# Using Ring Buffer in C++

We provide a Ring Buffer C++ wrapper. This implementation provides checks before inserting and
getting elements, which prevent inconsistent behavior.

# Build Tests

The Makefile in the directory **tests/** builds the plain-c ring-buffer Unit Tests.
